    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Brittany Walsch and I am 21 years old as of 2020. I am based in Maryland, where I was born and raised and where I graduated Aberdeen High School in 2017. When I decided what I wanted to go to college for,
      I originally wanted to study Cyber security as I knew I could make a substantial amount of money in that field. That all changed in 2018 when I got into a car accident with my best friend. As a result I had four fractures on
      my spine, and afterwards I found myself in a dark place, even losing interest in my major and not even wanting to return to school. I tried to force myself to continue in that field but I decided that if I was miserable studying it,
      then I would probably be miserable working in it. I switched my major during my recovery, being the best decision I could have made. I became happier and more motivated to go to college again. At the moment I am currently studying a double major,
      AFA Digital Arts and AFA Graphic Design at Harford Community College. Art plays a tremendous role in my life and I want to keep that art aspect in my life forever no matter what I am working on or where I am in the world. Moving forward, the next step
      is to get into an art school to further my knowledge about art overall and my field, along with further developing my skills</p>

  <div id="artist">
    <h1>I'm an Artist</h1>
    <p>From a young age I always did something related to art, whether it was building cities out of empty toilet paper rolls or construction paper, taking photos with disposable cameras, drawing little things to put on the fridge or give to family members.
      I always knew I had a passion for art and just stuck with it throughout my life, even going back to it for a major. Art is definitely safe place for me and I use it as an outlet. Because of this, I have developed my skills in photography, drawing, digital art,
      and painting. I have a newly found interest which is web design, which just so happens to be the basis of this website, as it is a project in my web design class that I am currently enrolled in. This is a good mix of my old major, Cyber security, as it requires
      coding in conjunction with art. I coded this website and designed it to my liking. I will continue to practice web design to enhance my skills, both technical and creative. If you know me then you know I like to pick up many interests as I get very motivated to
      learn everything related to it. So much so that I often forget all previous interests and get excited when I rediscover them. There's an abundant amount of different arts that I enjoy but listing them all would be impossible! Art is my passion and
      is something I pushed off as a career as it is definitely harder to make a living compared to my previous major, although is is something I want to do for the rest of my life. I wholeheartedly believe it is time for me to get serious about my passion and make it
      into a reality, from hobby to career.<br>

    <h1>About Blessed</h1>
    <p>I tried to make an artistic career about a year ago when I created Blessed. Originally, Blessed was going to be for photography, though I realized that I also had a interest in film. During the startup of Blessed, I managed to get a couple clients; friends, who hired
      me to do photo shoots for them. At the time I had a lot going on so I put Blessed on the backburner as I was working my 9 to 5 job. Nowadays, I definitely want to expand Blessed to be more than just photography and film, I want Blessed to represent me. Below are the
      logos for Blessed as well as the first shirt I bought with the logo on it. The Blessed logo was bought May 2, 2019 from a graphic designer on Twitter who had previously done work for me, his Twitter being @SoloJakee . At the time I wasn't into Graphic Design so it was
      easier to just have someone else make it for me and I fell in love with the result. As I mentioned before, I find many interest that I want to get into and film was another big thing. Since it correlates with photography I thought it would be easy as I could self-teach
      myself as I have never took film classes. The film focus I was after was short films, as a way to tell stories. Blessed would have been a joint effort with me and my coworker at the time, as he writes amazing short stories that I wanted to make into reality. Iâ€™m quite positive
      that my artistic career will take off in the near future and Blessed will become a business, having a name for itself.</p>
